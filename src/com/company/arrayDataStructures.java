    Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

    Abstract Data Type

    An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a
    data structure must adhere to.

    The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming
    language.
